Task solution is based on puppet configuration management. As Linux distributive is used CentOS v7. 
Vagrant directory structure: vagrant directory contains following directories and files 
/vagrant/repo : Centos local yum repository. From this repository puppet-agent and a few other packages will be installed.  If all boxes does not have internet access at all all necsesary packages in this repository can be placed.  

/vagrant/puppet/modules: all necessary puppet modules including for this task developed module "zbhelper" with ruby based zabbix action managment type zabbix_action_script. Zabbix_action_script type uses express42/zabbixapi ruby gem. 
For Java based publisher application (/opt/zb/src/AMQPublisher.java /opt/zb/bin/AMQPublisher.class )  and helper scripts  (/opt/zb/bin/*) managment are used zbhelper::jpublisher class. 
For python based AMQP consumer managment is used puppet class zbhelper::psleeper. 

/vagrant/puppet/manifest: contains main puppet node managment file site.pp .  

/rpm-gpg : contains necessary rpm GPG  keys. 

To start infrastructure development just run "vagrant up": this will create two boxes central and worker. Both machines will be automatically registered in zabbix. 
If additional worker_[1-9] box is required run vagrant up worker_1 , vagrant run worker_2 etc.  
All additional (worker_[1-9]) boxes must be developed only after central box development is finished, or those boxes will not be registered in zabbix monitoring system.

You can access zabbix monitoring system by address 
http://localhost:8080 
User:Admin 
Password:zabbix. 

There is a newly created and imported zabbix template Template_Linux_App_RabbitMQ. 
This template uses zabbix macro  {$ZPQ_QUOTA}  for queue threshold definition (default 90). If this threshold is reached zabbix will execute /opt/zb/bin/ontrigger.sh script. AMQP queue size item value renews every 30 sec.  

To publish mesages on AMQP just run vagrant ssh -c " /opt/zb/bin/jpublish.sh "  or "vagrant ssh central -c /opt/zb/bin/jpublish.sh " with a integer argument.  example vagrant ssh -c " /opt/zb/bin/jpublish.sh  12"
To publish  100 AMQP random integer values run:  vagrant ssh -c /opt/zb/bin/stress.sh
